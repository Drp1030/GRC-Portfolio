# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Portfolio

Welcome to my GRC Portfolio. My name is *Darshan Patel*, a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer and Information Systems from SUNY Old Westbury. I am actively pursuing the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification and seeking an entry-level opportunity in cybersecurity ‚Äî with a specific interest in GRC.

This portfolio showcases practical, hands-on projects that reflect my understanding of key GRC responsibilities including risk management, compliance, policy creation, and security frameworks. These documents are designed to simulate real-world processes and demonstrate my readiness for a professional role in the cybersecurity governance space.

## üöÄ Career Goals

I am working toward a career in **cybersecurity governance, risk management, and compliance**. I am especially interested in risk analysis, security auditing, regulatory compliance (HIPAA, NIST, ISO), and helping organizations establish strong security programs through documentation, policy, and framework alignment.

I believe GRC is one of the most essential and scalable areas in cybersecurity and I aim to grow as a Security Risk Analyst, GRC Associate, or Compliance Analyst.
