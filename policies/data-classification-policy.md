# Data Classification Policy

## Purpose
To establish a framework for classifying data based on sensitivity and to define appropriate handling practices for each classification level.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational data, whether stored digitally or physically, and to all users who interact with this data.

## Data Classification Levels

- **Public:** Information approved for public release. (e.g., marketing materials, job postings)
- **Internal:** Business-related data not intended for public disclosure. (e.g., internal memos, meeting notes)
- **Confidential:** Sensitive information requiring limited access. (e.g., employee records, financial reports)
- **Restricted:** Highly sensitive data with strict access control. (e.g., PHI, PII, customer data)

## Handling Guidelines

| Classification | Storage | Transmission | Access Control | Disposal |
|----------------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Public         | Unrestricted | No encryption required | Publicly accessible | Normal trash |
| Internal       | Approved storage | Internal encrypted channels | Internal personnel only | Shred or secure delete |
| Confidential   | Encrypted storage | Encrypted transmission required | Limited to authorized personnel | Shred or secure delete |
| Restricted     | Encrypted + monitored | Encrypted + access-controlled | Restricted to select personnel only | Shred + verify deletion |

## Responsibilities
All employees must understand and apply the appropriate handling procedures based on the data they interact with.

## Review Cycle
Policy will be reviewed annually or as compliance regulations evolve.
